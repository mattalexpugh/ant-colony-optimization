# 1-Ant Ant Colony Optimisation in JavaScript

Taken from an academic project, thought it was pretty cool nonetheless. Implementation of 1-Ant ACO in JavaScript and rendered through HTML5 canvas.

## Third Party Components

The only dependencies are those listed below, which are bundled with this repo.

 * Bootstrap
 * Underscore.js
 * Signma.js

## Usage

Standalone page, index.html launches the interface. JS libs could be used elsewhere if you found yourself needing to find a MST for any given problem in JavaScript.

## Final Words

This could probably do with some fixing up, unknown bugs etc - it is very fast though. Even in IE(!) Some code could be nicer but hey, it works. It was fun to do, especially cycle finding. If you find a use for it in your own work, do let me know.
