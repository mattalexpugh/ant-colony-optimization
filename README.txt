Launching the ACO System
========================

This system is implemented in HTML5 & JavaScript. Simply open index.html on any of the following browsers to use it:

 * Internet Explorer*
 * Mozilla Firefox
 * Google Chrome
 * Apple Safari

* Please note, if using Internet Explorer, a popup may come up asking to 'Allow Blocked Content' 
* or 'Enable Active Content', this is dependent on the security configuration of the computer in use.
* Allow or enable this content to permit the ACO experiments to run.

All dependent libraries are referenced from canonical paths, therefore provided they exist within the same folder as index.html, there should be no issues in testing the system.
